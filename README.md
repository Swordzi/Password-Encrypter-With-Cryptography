# Password-Encrypter-With-Cryptography
Encrypts and decrypts the password entered with MD5 (I know its not secure but its easy to implement and I wanted to try out something fast) 


So if you want a really secure encrpytion you should use HMAC or something else but this works fine for lower end projects that do not need a super high level security!
